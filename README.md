# Stone, Paper and Scissors
This code is a simple implementation of the popular game "Stone Paper Scissors" between a player and the computer. The game randomly chooses one of three objects: stone, paper, or scissors, and the player must choose one of them as well. The code then compares the choices and determines who the winner is based on the rules of the game.

The code begins by importing the random module to randomly select an object for the computer's turn. It then initializes three variables representing the three objects: stone, paper, and scissors.

The program prompts the player to input their choice of object by typing "S" for stone, "P" for paper, or "Ss" for scissors. It then prints the computer's choice of object.

The code then checks the player's choice against the computer's choice to determine the winner of the game. If the two choices match, it's a tie, otherwise, the winner is determined by the rules of the game. The program then prints the result of the game and thanks the player for playing.

Overall, this code is a simple implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game, making it a fun and easy-to-play game for anyone.
